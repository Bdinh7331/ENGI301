The goal of this project was to create a PCB of my first project, IcyHot, were I have successfully completed it. Upon consulting with my professor, Erik Welsh, he suggested
that I add in the LED screen that I was unable to integrate during my first project. This project is associated with Rice University's Introduction to Practical Electrical
Engineering course, also known as ENGI 301.

This project uses the following libraries:
1. ENGI301, created by Erik Welsh
2. nf-a4x20-5v-pwm, a custom library created by myself to house the Noctua fan
3. adafruit, which came with EAGLE

To approach the project, I did the following steps:
1. Create a schematic using existing Pocketbeagle, LED screen, and temperature sensors from the ENGI301 and adafruit libraries
2.
